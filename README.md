# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

## Challenge
The challenge was to build out this product card component that is a perfume so people can be interested in buying it, smelling so good for different occasions.

### Continued development

I would like to follow the next challenges to enhanced my understanding by practicing more in CSS tools like media queries and preprocessors.

## This is the final layout
